# Google Indexing & SEO Best Practices (2024-2025)

## How Google Indexes Websites

Google indexes websites through a three-step process:

### 1. **Crawling**
- Google deploys web crawlers (Googlebots) that systematically browse the internet
- Crawlers follow links from known pages to discover new content
- They continuously revisit pages to check for updates
- Crawlers analyze page content, structure, and metadata

### 2. **Indexing**
- Discovered content is analyzed and processed
- Information is stored in Google's vast index database
- The index contains billions of web pages organized for quick retrieval
- Only indexed pages can appear in search results

### 3. **Ranking**
- When users search, Google's algorithms evaluate indexed pages
- Pages are ranked based on relevance, quality, and user experience factors
- The most relevant and high-quality results are displayed to users
